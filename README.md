Proyecto "cliente real" - Cristian Camilo Paladines Heredia

## Bike Shop Mountain Sports

The purpose of this project is to create a website for a real client, in this case it is a bicycle store located in the municipality of Anolaima, which is a bicycle store that offers a wide variety of products and services such as the sale of parts and spare parts for bicycles. , all kinds of maintenance are also offered and there is also a sale of accessories for bicycles and for people who practice this great sport.

With this project we will seek to obtain more reach since the owner wants to continue expanding the territory of his store to the capital of Bogota and we both agreed that a web page for this business would provide greater reach, growth and recognition.

## Project status

This project is in a state of construction since as work is being done on it, continuous improvement is being worked on by the client and their respective feedback, for this we will work on future updates to reach the final product.

## The project has been built with:

Angular : ^14.0.4

## Possible bugs and erros

The page may have possible bugs and errors at the time of adding the products to the shopping cart and completing the purchase.

## Note

It is expected to correct the errors and to be able to add more things to make the project more attractive both visually for the client and owner and also to improve the interaction and experience when using this page.
